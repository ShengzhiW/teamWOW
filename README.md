### Good git commands to know
- git reset --hard origin/master:
  - This command will reset your local files to whatever is in the git repo 

### Things recently added:
- Pedometer working
- Each user account has individual step count (see the firebase database)

### Things to implement on soon:
- Refactoring code (split into multiple activities / services ??)
- Each user account should be able to read their step count back from the databaseinstead of it resetting every time.
- Navigation bar
- Leaderboards
-
