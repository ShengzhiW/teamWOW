# Introduction
Our project, OneWalk is a gamified pedometer app. Its purpose is to provide a fun and motivating incentive to encourage people to exercise daily. The three main features that OneWalk provides are: a customizable avatar and item shop, daily quests, and a leaderboard system. Users gain a Gary Buck for every hundred steps that they take, and can then use their Gary Bucks to purchase fun avatar items. Each day, a user has a random quest to walk a certain number of steps. When the user completes the quest, a certain amount of Gary Bucks are automatically added to their account. Finally, the top ten users have their name displayed on the global leaderboard to provide incentive for more active users. Through all these features, our app provides users with a fun and engaging experience to their daily exercise.
